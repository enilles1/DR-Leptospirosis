**Overview**

This repository contains the code and data to replicate or build on our analyses.

**Repository Structure**

**/data**: Contains the de-identified dataset of all study participants used for analyses. **df_lepto_deidentified_FINAL.csv**: This file includes de-identified data without personal identifiers. Age has been aggregated for de-identification purposes.

**/script-main**: Contains the R Markdown script for conducting the primary analysis and key figures. 

**/script-serocatalytic_models**: Contains the R Markdown script for conducting the force of infection analyses. Code generated by Eleanor Rees (https://github.com/erees). Note: this code used the original dataset with age as a continuous variable. The code will need to be modified to run this script with the provided age-aggregated dataset (df_lepto_deidentified_FINAL.csv).
